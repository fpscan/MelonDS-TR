## SAME MELONDS, JUST TURKISH...

DS emulator, sorta

The goal is to do things right and fast, akin to blargSNES (but hopefully better). But also to, you know, have a fun challenge :)
<hr>

## How to use

melonDS requires BIOS/firmware copies from a DS. Files required:
 * bios7.bin, 16KB: ARM7 BIOS
 * bios9.bin, 4KB: ARM9 BIOS
 * firmware.bin, 128/256/512KB: firmware

Firmware boot requires a firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite.
DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games directly.

### Possible firmware sizes

 * 128KB: DSi/3DS DS-mode firmware (reduced size due to lacking bootcode)
 * 256KB: regular DS firmware
 * 512KB: iQue DS firmware

DS BIOS dumps from a DSi or 3DS can be used with no compatibility issues. DSi BIOS dumps (in DSi mode) are not compatible. Or maybe they are. I don't know.

As for the rest, the interface should be pretty straightforward. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask, though!

## How to build

### Linux:

* Install dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libpcap0.8-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libsdl2-dev gtk+-3.0
```

* Compile:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```



### Windows:

 * use CodeBlocks
 * or receive golden cookies if you get Cmake to work

Build system is not set in stone.

## TODO LIST

 * improve libui and the emulator UI
 * hardware renderer for 3D (w/ upscaling and fancy shit)
 * support for rendering screens to separate windows
 * emulating some fancy addons
 * other non-core shit (debugger, graphics viewers, cheat crapo, etc)

### TODO LIST FOR LATER

 * better wifi
 * maybe emulate flashcarts or other fancy hardware
 * big-endian compatibility (Wii, etc)
 * LCD refresh time (used by some games for blending effects)
 * any feature you can eventually ask for that isn't outright stupid

## Credits

 * Martin for GBAtek, a good piece of documentation
 * Cydrak for the extra 3D GPU research
 * All of you comrades who have been testing melonDS, reporting issues, suggesting shit, etc
